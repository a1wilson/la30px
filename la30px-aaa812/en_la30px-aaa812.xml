        <p xml:id="la30px-aaa812-d1e111"> The Pope (Vicar of Jesus Christ), by divine authority—and
          all the kingdoms of the heavens and the earth belong to God—licitly and justly gave the
          monarchs of Castilla and León supreme and sovereign lordship over the whole universe of
          the Indies. He thus made them supreme emperors over many kings. He chose their catholic
          persons, royal excellence and dignity, and their royal industry as a most convenient, and
          even necessary, means of achieving the said Christian end of preaching the Gospel. 
          
          Thus
          the Pope accepted and proved his imperial supremacy over the infidels in the world. He did
          not attain such supremacy by tyranny, as the Romans had. This was done so that the Emperor
          could be the advocate and defender of the universal Church, adopting it as a son. Such
          supremacy is exercised at the Pope’s discretion for the spiritual good of Christianity. He
          could also do the same thing anywhere else, as he did in transferring power from the
          Greeks to the Germans. By the same token he prohibited other Christian kings, on pain of
          excommunication, to go to, or send anyone to the Indies without permission from the
          monarchs of Castilla. </p>
