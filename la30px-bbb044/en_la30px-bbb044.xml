          The kings of Castille are obligated by divine right to
          procure the preaching of the faith of Jesus Christ, in the same way that he, Son of God,
          established in his Church. This is also the way that his apostles pursued it, that the
          universal Church always had as its custom, and also in its decrees has ordered, and the
          holy doctors advance and elaborate upon in their books. Namely, this way is peaceful,
          loving, sweet, and caringly, by gentleness, and humility, and good examples. Thus they are
          to invite the infidels, and mostly the Indians, who by their nature are most docile, and
          most humble, and peaceful, giving them first gifts from us, and dominating nothing of
          theirs. And so they will understand that a good, pleasant and just God is the God of the
          Christians. Hence, they will want to be his and to receive his catholic faith and holy
          doctrine.
