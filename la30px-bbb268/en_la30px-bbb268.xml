          The Castilian monarchs are obligated by divine law to put
          government over the natural peoples of the Indies. This government must maintain their
          just laws and good customs, and remove bad ones (which werenâ€™t many), and add any defects
          in their policy (mostly preaching the Gospel) towards spreading the faith and prospering
          the peoples of the Americas. The Castilian monarchs are to sacrifice much their own
          material34 interests and income, so that those peoples might be helped and not impeded
          with regard to the spiritual. This includes their conversion and receiving of our catholic
          faith, and the exercise of the holy sacraments of the Church. Justice and rights should
          also be upheld for them. Moreover, they should be principally increased and prospered in
          their bodily life, and in everything which pertains to their material good. This is the
          ultimate cause for which, or reason why, the Castilian monarchs were given these lands
          (none of which they had anything in before)
