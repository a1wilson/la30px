          Fernando and Isabel, monarchs of Castilla and León, have
          singular prerogatives—more than other Christian kings—in that they were vested with the
          office of preaching the Gospel to the New World, by the Vicar of Christ. It was by nothing
          less than divine authority that they were instituted and invested with the highest dignity
          that kings have ever had over the earth. That is, they are the architectonic apostles of
          the Indies. 
          
          Among other excellencies, they had these two. The first, which they inherited
          from their ancestors’ dedication to the Reconquista, was their reconquest of all these
          kings of Spain from the tyrannical Mahometan enemies of the faith. They achieved this with
          much spilling of their own royal blood and with their own royal persons. By incomparable
          works, they finally restored the great kingdom of Granada to Christ and to the universal
          Church. 
          
          The second was that, at their own expense and by their favor and command, they
          sent Columbus, who they honored with the title of First Admiral, and so the most extensive
          Indies were discovered.
